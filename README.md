### Conclusion

This assignment was very interesting and entertaining for me, but since it was my first time working with SpringBoot, it was not easy. 

I was able to use my knowledge of Java and MySQL, connect my program to the Docker container, and use the MySQLWorkbench application. 

At this point, the Microservice application is not completely complete and I hope that once I have fully explored SpringBoot, I can return to this project and finish it. 

Thank you for your attention and I hope to be able to get in touch with you in the future! ðŸ™‚
