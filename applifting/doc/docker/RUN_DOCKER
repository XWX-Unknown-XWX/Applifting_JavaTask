Shutting Down & Cleaning Up

Run docker-compose up again and youâ€™ll be right where you left off.

Run (docker-compose down) afterwards and your container should be shut down.

If you want a fresh start for everything, run (docker system prune -a) and (docker volume prune).
The first command removes any unused containers and the second removes any unused volumes.

I recommend doing this fairly often since Docker likes to stash everything away causing the gigabytes to add up.
